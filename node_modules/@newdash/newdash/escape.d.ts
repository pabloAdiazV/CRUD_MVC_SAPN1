/**
 * Converts the characters "&", "<", ">", '"', and "'" in `string` to their
 * corresponding HTML entities.
 *
 * **Note:** No other characters are escaped. To escape additional
 * characters use a third-party library like [_he_](https://mths.be/he).
 *
 * Though the ">" character is escaped for symmetry, characters like
 * ">" and "/" don't need escaping in HTML and have no special meaning
 * unless they're part of a tag or unquoted attribute value. See
 * [Mathias Bynens's article](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/ambiguous-ampersands)
 * (under "semi-related fun fact") for more details.
 *
 * When working with HTML you should always
 * [quote attribute values](http://wonko.com/post/html-escaping) to reduce
 * XSS vectors.
 *
 * @since 5.12.0
 * @category String
 * @param string The string to escape.
 * @returns Returns the escaped string.
 * @see [[escapeRegExp]], [[unescape]]
 * @example
 *
 * ```js
 * escape('fred, barney, & pebbles')
 * // => 'fred, barney, &amp; pebbles'
